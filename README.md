# README: Writing Efficient Code in Cython

## Overview
Cython is a powerful programming language that serves as a superset of Python, enabling developers to write code that achieves performance levels comparable to C. By leveraging Cython, you can optimize Python code and gain fine-grained control over memory management and data types.

## Introduction to Cython
Cython combines the ease of Python with the performance of C, allowing for the optimization of existing Python code. Understanding the difference between low-level and high-level programming languages is key to appreciating Cython's benefits:
- **Low-level languages** provide minimal abstraction from a computer's instruction set, enabling fast execution and small memory footprints.
- **High-level languages** allow easier human interaction with computer systems but may introduce inefficiencies.

## Benefits of Using Cython
Cython enables you to:
- Write Python code that calls C or C++ functions natively.
- Enhance Python code performance by adding static type declarations.
- Use combined source-level debugging for Python and Cython code.
- Efficiently interact with large datasets, particularly with NumPy arrays.
- Seamlessly integrate with existing libraries and applications.

## Cython Function Types
Cython defines three types of functions:
- **cdef**: C-level functions that cannot be called directly in pure Python.
- **cpdef**: C-level functions with Python bindings, allowing them to be called from pure Python.
- **def**: Pure Python functions.

### Example of Function Declarations
```cython
cdef int i            # declare an integer variable
cdef double d = 10.1  # declare and initialize a double
